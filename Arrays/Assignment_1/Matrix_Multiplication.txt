ALGORITHM:
matrixMultiply(A, B):
Assume dimension of A is (m x n), dimension of B is (p x q)
Begin
   if n is not same as p, then exit
   otherwise define C matrix as (m x q)
   for i in range 0 to m - 1, do
      for j in range 0 to q â€“ 1, do
         for k in range 0 to p, do
            C[i, j] = C[i, j] + (A[i, k] * A[k, j])
         done
      done
   done
